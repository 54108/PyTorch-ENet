# CamVid Dataset

The Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) is a collection of over ten minutes of high quality 30Hz footage with object class semantic labels at 1Hz and in part, 15Hz. Each pixel is associated with one of 32 classes.

The CamVid dataset uses a different structure than the one provided by the CamVid authors, developed by the authors of SegNet. [Download link here](https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial/tree/master/CamVid).
